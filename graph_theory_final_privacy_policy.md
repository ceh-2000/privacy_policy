This app does not collect any personal information from users. It displays a map with weighted edges that correspond to pressure changes taken across William & Mary's campus. Users can select start and end locations to compute traveling paths. This app was created as a final project for the Graph Theory course at William & Mary. It does not require users to log in to access the public map data.
